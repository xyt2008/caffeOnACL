 1. Purpose
This document will help user utilize the code of CaffeOnACL(Caffe+ACL) to improve the performance of their applications based on the Caffe framework.

# 2. Setup applicaiton developmnet evironment
## 2.1 ACL and Caffe Libraris build
Please refer to [build caffeOnACL](https://github.com/OAID/caffeOnACL/tree/master/acl_openailab/README.md).

## 2.2 ACL and Caffe Libraris installation
There are two ways to use the libraris after build them.
### Install libraries to standard direcotry '/usr/local/lib'
	sudo cp ~/oaid/ComputeLibrary/build/arm_compute/libarm_compute.so /usr/local/lib/.
	sudo cp ~/oaid/caffeOnACL/distribute/lib/libcaffe.so /usr/local/lib/.

### Or, install libraries to a temporarily directory. then set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is this direcotry. For example, install libraries to `~oaid`
	mkdir ~/oaid/lib
	cp ~/oaid/ComputeLibrary/build/libarm_compute.so ~/oaid/lib/.
	cp ~/oaid//caffeOnACL/distribute/lib/libcaffe.so ~/oaid/lib/.
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/oaid/lib

# 2.3 How to write Makefile for applications
First, please make sure that environmnet variable "ACL_ROOT" and "CAFFE_ROOT" is set properly (them are set during the process of ACL and Caffe libraries buiding). Double check them by command just like "echo $VAR".<br>
In the Makefile, it needs include the following lines :

	include $(CAFFE_ROOT)/Makefile.config
	CAFFE_INCS = -I$(CAFFE_ROOT)/include -I$(CAFFE_ROOT)/distribute/include/
	CAFFE_LIBS = -L$(CAFFE_ROOT)/distribute/lib -lcaffe  -lglog -lgflags -lprotobuf -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem

# 3. Application configuration guide
## 3.1 Configuration options on compiling time
Modify the vaule of Make Variables in `$(CAFFE_ROOT)/Makefile.config` to USE or _NOT_ USE some function by Caffe.

* "USE_ACL := 1" (Enable ACL support on ARM Platform), "USE_ACL :=0" (Disable ACL support on ARM Platform) 
* "USE_PROFILING := 1" (Enable profiling), "USE_PROFILING := 0" (Disable profiling)
* Experimental functions:

	When USE_PROFILING is true, enable "Layer's performance statistic" which controlled by Marco "LAYER_PERF_STAT", is defined by "-DLAYER_PERF_STAT" in "$(CAFFE_ROOT)/Makefile", can remove it to disable the feature.
	Add "-DUSE_CONV_CACHE" to "COMMON_FLAGS" into "$(CAFFE_ROOT)/Makefile" to enable the cache of convolution layer

## 3.2 Configure the bypass of ACL Layer
Can set environment "BYPASSACL" to bypass ACL layers, the control bit definitions are listed in the table below:

	BYPASS_ACL_ABSVAL  	0x00000001
	BYPASS_ACL_BNLL    	0x00000002
	BYPASS_ACL_CONV    	0x00000004
	BYPASS_ACL_FC      	0x00000008
	BYPASS_ACL_LRN     	0x00000010
	BYPASS_ACL_POOLING 	0x00000020
	BYPASS_ACL_RELU    	0x00000040
	BYPASS_ACL_SIGMOID 	0x00000080
	BYPASS_ACL_SOFTMAX 	0x00000100
	BYPASS_ACL_TANH    	0x00000200

For instance, type "export BYPASSACL=0x100" to bypass ACL Softmax layer; and "export BYPASSACL=0x124" to bypass ACL Softmax, Pooling and Convolution layers.

## 3.3 Configure the log information
can set "LOGACL" to log the performance information of ACL and related caffe layers, the control bit definitions are listed in the table below:

	ENABLE_LOG_APP_TIME 	0x00000001
	ENABLE_LOG_ALLOCATE 	0x00000002
	ENABLE_LOG_RUN      	0x00000004
	ENABLE_LOG_CONFIG   	0x00000008
	ENABLE_LOG_COPY     	0x00000010
	ENABLE_LOG_ABSVAL   	0x00000020
	ENABLE_LOG_BNLL     	0x00000040
	ENABLE_LOG_CONV     	0x00000080
	ENABLE_LOG_FC       	0x00000100
	ENABLE_LOG_LRN      	0x00000200
	ENABLE_LOG_POOLING  	0x00000400
	ENABLE_LOG_RELU     	0x00000800
	ENABLE_LOG_SIGMOID  	0x00001000
	ENABLE_LOG_SOFTMAX  	0x00002000
	ENABLE_LOG_TANH     	0x00004000

For instance, type "export LOGACL=0x100" to output the performance information of FC layer; "export BYPASSACL=0x380" to output the performance information of LRN, FC and Convolution layers. You can copy the logs into Microsoft excel, the sum the time information with separated terms, the column of excel sheet like this :<br>

# 4. Test and Performance Tuning Guide
## 4.1 To run the application with ACL and log performance information
Assume your working directory is : ~\test

* Use all ACL layers by set BYPASSACL to 0

	export BYPASSACL=0

* If compile the caffeOnACL with "USE_PROFILING := 1", to decide which information is logged into file by setting LOGACL. For instance, we log all layers' information by setting LOGACL to 0x7fe1.

	export LOGACL=0x7fe1

* To check if "configure" take lots of time, can set LOGACL to 0x08.

	export LOGACL=0x08

* To check if "memory copy" take lots of time, we can set LOGACL to 0x10.

	export LOGACL=0x10

* Run your application and get the information of performance

	./your_application parameters…

* When got the log, copy it into Microsoft excel, and sum the columns. For examle, run the AlexNet as the example – command line is : 

	taskset -a 10 ./distribute/bin/classification.bin ./models/bvlc_alexnet/deploy.prototxt ./models/bvlc_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel data/ilsvrc12/imagenet_mean.binaryproto data/ilsvrc12/synset_words.txt  examples/images/cat.jpg

## 4.2 To run the application with original Caffe's layers and log performance information
Assume your work directory is ~\test.

* to use all ACL layers by set BYPASSACL to 0xffffffff
	export BYPASSACL=0xffffffff
* If compile the caffeOnACL with "USE_PROFILING := 1", to decide which information is logged into file by setting LOGACL. For instance, we log all layers' information by setting LOGACL to 0x7fe1. (In this case, ENABLE_LOG_ALLOCATE、ENABLE_LOG_RUN、ENABLE_LOG_CONFIG and ENABLE_LOG_COPY are invalidate, these flags are all for ACL layers)

	export LOGACL=0x7fe1

* Run your application and get the information of performance

	./your_application parameters…
* When got the log, we can copy it into Microsoft excel, and sum the columns

## 4.3 Improve the performance by mixing ACL Layers and Caffe’s original Layers
After retrieving the performance statistic data of Caffe's layers and ACL's layers in your application, we can compare their respective performances:
![AlexNet_acl_vs_openblas_perf_pic](https://oaid.github.io/pics/caffeonacl/AlexNet_acl_vs_openblas_perf_pic.png)

From the table above, we can observe that in the original caffe’s layer, CONV、FC、RELU and Softmax have faster running times than ACL’s layers. Therefore, we can set BYPASSACL to 0x14c to BYPASS the 4 ACL layers, and utilize the original caffe’s layers in the application. By choosing the layerset with the faster running time for each layer, we can optimize the total running time for this application
#### The performance data is :
![performance_data_excel_pic](https://oaid.github.io/pics/caffeonacl/performance_data_excel_pic.png)

As you can see, we obtain optimal performance in combined mode (ACL: LRN、Pooling，Caffe’s original Layers：Conv、FC、RELU、Softmax) as in the table below:
